# Pink Hair Index

To be also known as ɸ, the Pink Hair Index is proposed as follows:

Consider remarks made by strangers in public addressing my pink hairstyle.
Let ↑ and ↓ be the number of positive and number of negative such remarks, respectively.
Let ↔ be the length of the observation period in days.
Then, the pink hair index is defined as ɸ = (↑ - ↓)/↔.

The pink hair formula may be updated in a straightforward way to make the index dependent on the country of visit.
The values of index by country may then be elegantly visualized in the form of a choropleth map.
And this is what this page is all about.

For simplicity, let's assume that there wouldn't be more than 1 remark per day on average.
Under this – admitedly somewhat strong – assumption, the scale for the index values may be chosen as the range [-1, 1].
Also note that there is a clear difference between an index value of 0, meaning balanced ↑ and ↓ (including the special case of no remarks),
and “no data”, that is a country I haven't visited during the observation period.

Ok, let's go...to see the map itself.
