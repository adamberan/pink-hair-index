# Pink Hair Index

To be also known as ɸ, the Pink Hair Index is proposed as follows:

Consider remarks made by strangers in public addressing my pink hairstyle.
Let ↑ and ↓ be the number of positive and number of negative such remarks, respectively.
Let ↔ be the length of the observation period in days.
Then, the pink hair index is defined as ɸ = (↑ - ↓)/↔.

The pink hair formula may be updated in a straightforward way to make the index dependent on the country of visit.
The values of index by country may then be elegantly visualized in the form of a choropleth map.
And this is what this page is all about.

For simplicity, let's assume that there wouldn't be more than 1 remark per day on average.
Under this – admitedly somewhat strong – assumption, the scale for the index values may be chosen as the range [-1, 1].
Also note that there is a clear difference between an index value of 0, meaning balanced ↑ and ↓ (including the special case of no remarks),
and “no data”, that is a country I haven't visited during the observation period.

Also, there are clear shortcomings of the defition of the index, namely a limited comparability of the values accross countries:
- the density of population is different in different places (say the Hong Kong Island vs. a Finnish countryside),
- i might have done different kind of activities in differend places (say working from home vs. a sighseeing vacation),
- the specific places i've visited might not represent the whole country (say Bali vs. Jakarta),
- and probably many more that don't occur to me at this moment.

Hence, this whole venture should only be taken as a fun little personal project; there's no ambition to gain any universally valid insights from this.

Ok, let's go...to see the map itself.
